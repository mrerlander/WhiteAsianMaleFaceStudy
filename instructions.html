          <b class="font-weight-bold">INSTRUCTIONS: </b>You will see various
          pairs of faces. As each pair is presented, your task is simply to rate
          the similarity of the two faces in the pair. You will make this rating
          on a scale of 1 &#40;Highly Dissimilar&#41; to 9 &#40;Highly
          Similar&#41;. This scale will appear along with the items to remind
          you of how to make your judgments.

        <p>
          <b class="font-weight-bold">INSTRUCTIONS: </b>This task is designed to
          investigate your perceptions of the similarities between the faces --
          there are no "right" or "wrong" answers, and the way you use the
          rating scale will likely be different from other participants. Just
          try to make your ratings truly reflective of how similar you feel the
          faces are. If you think that the faces in a pair are very dissimilar,
          use the lower part of the scale. If you think that they are very
          similar, use the upper part. Use the middle part of the scale when you
          think the two faces are of medium similarity. Please try to use the
          entire length of the scale when making your judgments.
